        // start and end are always trying to find max element in the above 2 checks
        // hence, when they are pointing to just one element, that is the max one because that is what the checks say
        // more elaboration: at every point of time for start and end, they have the best possible answer till that time
        // and if we are saying that only one item is remaining, hence cuz of above line that is the best possible ans
